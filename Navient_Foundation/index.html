In 2017 the CFPB sued Navient on the basis of its failure to provide ideal help to customers. Navient filed to dismiss this suit, which is still open. In 2018, nine teachers sued Navient on the grounds that Navient misled borrowers from accessing Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Settled in 2020, this required Navient to donate $1.75 million to a nonprofit student counseling organization. Borrowers received no compensation from the suit. 
<p></p>
Navient continues to vehemently deny the allegations set forth in the lawsuits.
