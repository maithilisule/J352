    <h3> I <strong><em>love</em></strong> Saap. He is a three year old Florida King Snake we adopted from some friends. He is very friendly even though he bit me once and he has bitten my family members numerous times. Saap loves eating mice and he loves slithering around. If you have warm freshly dried laundry, I am sure Saap will find his way there. </h3> </p>

  <h3> Saap's favorite food is frozen thawed mice. He loves to eat about three or four every other week, and he enjoys taking huge naps afterward! </h3> </p>
